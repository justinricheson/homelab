# externalTrafficPolicy: Local is used so that the ip is only advertised from node(s) where the pod is running.
# Without this, MetalLB will arp advertise the ip on all nodes, and internally proxy requests when they land on a node where the pod isn't running.
# However, doing this means that the requests are internally NAT'ed, causing the source ip's to be replaced with an internal k8s ip.
# This causes technitium to show all requests coming from a single internal ip.
